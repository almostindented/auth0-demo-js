# Auth0 JavaScript Demo
![CodeQL](https://github.com/almostindented/auth0-demo-js/workflows/CodeQL/badge.svg)

This project is a demo for Auth0, adapted from Auth0's Quick Start guide.
It was designed by [@almostindented](https://github.com/almostindented) and loads the Auth0 library from the CDN.

It is a basic app, which allows the user to sign in, sign up, log out and view basic profile information like their nickname, email and avatar.
