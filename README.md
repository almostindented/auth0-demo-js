# Auth0 JavaScript Demo

This project is a demo for Auth0, adapted from Auth0's Quick Start guide.
It was designed by [@almostindented](https://github.com/almostindented) and loads the Auth0 library from the CDN.

It is a basic app, which allows the user to sign in, sign up, log out and view basic profile information like their nickname, email and avatar.

Looking to dive right in? Check out Setup.md to get started.

Just the stylish, 100%-CSS buttons you're after? All the code is on a GitHub Gist.
